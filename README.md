# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is intended to help developers and sorting enthusiasts gain a deeper understanding of how classic algorithms work in real-time.

## Features

The visualization tool has multiple functions which are prompted by clicking the labeled buttons. The "Generate Bars" button will reset any present bars and initialize a fresh array of values, represented by the varied length bars.

The sorting functions included are:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort

Once pressed, the sorting buttons will begin animating the associated sorting process. Targeted bars are highlighted before a swap for easier tracking and comprehension of the processees.

## Development

This project was my first experience with React App and installing Node.js. The elements were created as React components and designed using HTML5/CSS. The algorithms were implemented in JavaScript. Since my most familiar programming language is Python, this project also presented a great opportunity to familiarize myself with a new language and reinforce my understanding of common algorithms.

This project was inspired by a video from Cl√©ment Mihailescu ( @clem ) on youtube. The youtube profile can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@clem)
